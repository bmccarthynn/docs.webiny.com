# Changes

This release contains lots of important upgrades, from developer experience, to performance improvements, to maintainability. The primary focus of this release is the ability to connect your project to Webiny Control Panel to unlock extra features, analytics, etc. Another important milestone is a completely new approach to building and customizing your project infrastructure using Pulumi. This allowed us to remove _all_ the infrastructure code from the project, making your project easier to understand, maintain, and upgrade.

<Alert type={"info"}>
  
  Note that some of these improvements are only available if you're creating a new project with Webiny 5.29.0. If you're just upgrading from earlier versions, your project will only partially benefit from all the cool stuff that's included in this release. 
  <br/><br/>
  Also note that there's currently no way to completely migrate earlier versions of projects to the new project architecture (new Pulumi, less files, etc.). However, you'll still be getting all the current and future business logic upgrades and fixes, because the business logic is not connected to the architecture itself.

## Webiny Control Panel

// Adrian (a video of CLI login or WCP dashboard maybe?)

## Prerendering Service

### Migrate to Event Driven Architecture ([#2469](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2469))
 - event driven (no cron jobs, less Lambda invocations, immediate re-render)
 - new database records
 - simpler programmatic usage
 - throw 400 when domain can't be mapped to a tenant
 - MT system with just 1 tenant doesn't require a custom domain!

## Brand New Project Setup

With this release, we're introducing a brand new project setup! 

By essentially removing all of the unnecessary files and folders included in every Webiny project, we believe this new setup will be a huge step forward in making Webiny as easy to use and understand as possible! 

The following are some of the more import changes the new setup brings.

### Removed Unnecessary Files and Folders

Prior to this release, once a new Webiny project has been created, users would immediately be presented (or intimidated) with a lot of different folders and files. For example, if we were to look into the [`api`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code) folder, we would be able to find five different folders which contain application code for 14 different AWS Lambda functions. Together, these functions form Webiny's GraphQL APIs.

And while this approach does give users the ability to customize every aspect of Webiny, in practice, we've seen the vast majority of these are not really something user's are concerned with. When talking about the [`api`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code) folder, almost always, the only two folders in which users are making some changes are [`api/code/graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code/graphql) and [`api/code/headlessCms`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code/headlessCms).

<Alert type="info" title="Project Applications">

The [`api/code/graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code/graphql) and [`api/code/headlessCms`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api/code/headlessCms) folders contain code for the two GraphQL APIs - the Main GraphQL API and the [Headless CMS GraphQL API](/docs/headless-cms/basics/using-graphql-api).

</Alert>

With this, and a couple of other use cases mind, we've decided to drastically cut down on the total number of files and folders that are included in every Webiny project. This includes:

1. instead of 14, the `api` folder now includes only 2 AWS Lambda functions: Main GraphQL API and Headless CMS GraphQL API
2. we've removed `code` folders that were located in [`api`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/api), [`apps/admin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/apps/admin) and [`apps/website`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.28.0/apps/website) folders as they were redundant and causing unnecessary nesting of folders
3. Pulumi infrastructure code is now also abstracted away from users (more on this in the following section) 
4. the [`babel.node.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.28.0/.babel.node.js) and [`babel.react.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.28.0/.babel.react.js) Babel configuration files were also removed from the project 

### Faster API Deployments

With the changes listed in the [Removed Unnecessary Files and Folders](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog#removed-unnecessary-files-and-folders) section in mind, one might ask themselves:
 
> If there are only 2 AWS Lambda functions in my project now, what happened to other 12? Do they still exist?

Well, these function still do exist, but they are actually prebuilt for users' projects. This means that, upon deploying the [API project application](/docs/architecture/api/introduction), users do not need to build these functions themselves. In other words, this means much faster deployment times! 

To be more precise, you can expect a **~70%** reduction in time it takes to build the API project application and a **~50%** reduction in time it takes to deploy it. 

### `api` Folder (Project Application) Moved To `apps` Folder

Previously, the `api` folder (which contains the API project application) was located in the project root. This is no longer the case. All project applications are now located in the [`apps`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5/apps) folder.
