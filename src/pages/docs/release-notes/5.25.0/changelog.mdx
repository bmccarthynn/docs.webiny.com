# Changes



## Other

### Source map support

All of our packages will now have source maps generated. That will greatly help debugging issues.
We have also added source map support for all lambda functions.
It's enabled by default, but you can disable it by adding `sourceMaps: false` to `createBuildFunction` inside your lambdas' `webiny.config.ts` files.

### GraphQL errors include stacktrace

We've added a new stacktrace field (namely `stack`) to errors returned from GraphQL API for a better debugging experience.
This behavior is optional and needs to be enabled by passing `DEBUG=true` environmental variable (for example to your `.env` file).
For best experience it requires source maps to be enabled.
