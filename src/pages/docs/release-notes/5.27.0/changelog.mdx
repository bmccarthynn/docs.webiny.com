# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Removed Unnecessary Variables Passed Into Storage Operations ([#2403](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2403))

We removed `latestEntry` and `latestStorageEntry` from being passed into the storage operations because they are not required for storage operations to work properly - they were used for debugging.
