## Core

### Use Fastify To Handle Lambda Invocations [#2546](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2546)

Up until this release, we handled Lambda invocations with custom functions which forced us to do lots of manual checks and event normalization.
With this version, we switched all event routing and normalization to [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/). It will allow us to easily switch to other clouds in the future, since Fastify is now responsible for event normalization, and within Webiny, we now use a standard `request` object.

This change will also help us refactor the system to use one Lambda function for handling of various GraphQL schemas, and share the entire Webiny context (all app SDKs) within a single Lambda event lifecycle. This means easier maintenance, easier customization, easier integration with various Webiny lifecycle events, etc.

To find out more about the new handlers, read our [Routes and Events](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/routes-and-events) article.
