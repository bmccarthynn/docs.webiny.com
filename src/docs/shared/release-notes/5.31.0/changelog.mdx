## Development

### Core

#### Use Fastify To Handle Requests [#2546](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2546)
With this version we implemented [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) to handle requests towards our system.

This is a core change which will help us later with refactoring the system to use one Lambda for all the GraphQL requests, that are going towards our system.

To find out more about it, read our [Routes and Events](/docs/core-development-concepts/basics/routes-and-events) article.


...stay tuned.
