## Description

The diagram gives an overview of the complete cloud infrastructure that's needed to host the **Website** project application and, in combination with the **Core** and **API** project applications, that makes prerendering of pages possible.

We have two Amazon CloudFront distributions <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter> <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter>, two Amazon S3 buckets <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter> <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>, and the Webiny Prerendering Service <diagram-letter>E</diagram-letter> that consists of three AWS Lambda functions and an Amazon SQS. We also have the **Core** and **API** project applications, which are also involved in the whole process (more on this soon).

<Alert type="info">

To learn more about the **Core** and **API** project applications' cloud infrastructure, check out the [Core](../../architecture/core/introduction) and [API](../../architecture/api/introduction) sections.
