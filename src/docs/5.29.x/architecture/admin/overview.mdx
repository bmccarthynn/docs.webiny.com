## Description

The diagram gives an overview of the complete cloud infrastructure that's needed to host the Admin Area application.

As we can see, it consists of two resources - Amazon CloudFront <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter> and Amazon S3 bucket <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter>.

In the upcoming [Serving Application Files](/docs/{version}/architecture/admin/serving-application-files) section, we examine how the Admin Area application is served to actual users.
