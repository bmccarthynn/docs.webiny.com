# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Added GraphQL Required Input ([#2144](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2144))

We added the non-null input mark (`!`) for the fields which have `required` validators set.

## Development

### Added Webiny Version Header To GraphQL Response ([#2143](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2143))

We added the Webiny version header to every GraphQL response. By default, header is not added. To add it into the output, read our article about [environment variables](/docs/key-topics/environment-variables).
