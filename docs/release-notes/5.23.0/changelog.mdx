# Changes

The major focus of this release was the improving Headless CMS entry creation experience when it comes to a model with **ref** field.
It's been long overdue, and it's finally done. Along the way we also did a few bug fixes.

To see everything we worked on, see the details below.

## Headless CMS

### Create Ref Field Entry on Fly ([#2215](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2215))

A new way of creating entry has been introduced to the **ref** field type.
Now users can create a new reference field entry(if it doesn't exist) right from a content entry form without having to go back to the reference model entry form to create one.

In other words, users can generate reference field entries on the fly.

How it looks when creating an entry:

<CenteredImage shadow={false} title="Create new ref field entry button" src={createNewRefFieldEntry}/>

<CenteredImage shadow={false} title="Create new ref field entry dialog" src={createNewRefFieldEntryDialog}/>

At the moment, we don't support this feature if the referenced model also has reference field(s). As a workaround, you need to start adding docs backward to every model in the reference chain.

Also, in case the **Use as list of...** option is enabled and multiple models are being referenced, please make sure the referenced values exist before setting the reference.
