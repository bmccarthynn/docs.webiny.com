# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Added Unique Validator For Text Field ([#2166](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2166))

A new **unique** validator has been introduced to the **text** type field.

As the name itself suggests, when enabled on a particular field, the validator will ensure two different content entries cannot have the same value for it.

The validator can be enabled via the **Validators** tab in the field options screen.

### Added Default Field Values ([#2184](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2184))

#### Boolean Field

We added the ability to set the default value for the boolean field (**true** or **false**).

#### Date/time Fields

All of the date/time-related fields can now optionally be set with the current date/time as their default value.

If enabled, note that the default value will be set on the frontend side, while creating a new content entry. Essentially, this way user's timezone can also be taken into consideration upon setting field's default value.

#### Text And Number Fields

Upon creating a text or number field with the **Use predefined values**  option enabled, users can now choose which of the defined value should be the initially selected one.

How it looks when creating the model field:

<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  style={{ maxWidth: 850 }}
  alt="Predefined single value"
  src={singlePredefinedValues}
/>
How it looks when creating the entry:
<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  style={{ maxWidth: 850 }}
  alt="Predefined single selected value"
  src={selectedSinglePredefinedValues}
/>

Also, in case the **Use as list of...** option is enabled, multiple initially selected values can be set too.

<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  style={{ maxWidth: 850 }}
  alt="Predefined multiple values"
  src={multiplePredefinedValues}
/>
How it looks when creating the entry:
<CenteredImage
  shadow={false}
  style={{ maxWidth: 850 }}
  alt="Predefined single selected value"
  src={selectedMultiplePredefinedValues}
/>

When creating new content entry in the Admin app, be aware that if you unmark all the checkboxes or radio buttons, the field's value will end up being empty. To prevent that from happening, you can enable the **Required** field validator.

### Fixed Date Clear Admin UI Crash ([#2185](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2185))

We fixed an issue which woud occur when a user tried to clear the value from an existing **Date/Time** field. From now on, the field's value will either be completely cleared, or it will be set to current date/time if the new [default value option](/docs/release-notes/5.22.0/changelog#datetime-fields) has been enabled.

### Upgraded Webpack to version 5 ([#2101](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2101))

We use webpack to build API lambda functions and react apps. We finally upgraded it to version 5.
Along with this, we added [react-refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh) for better hot module reloading and development experience.
We are also working on simplifying project structure and removing boilerplate code.
For example in this release some of babel configuration is no longer necessary.
