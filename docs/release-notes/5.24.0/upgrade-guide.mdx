- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.23.1 to 5.24.0

:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.24.0 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.24.0/changelog) to get familiar with the changes introduced in this release.
:::

## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.24.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.24.0`.

:::warning
As we mentioned in the changelog, we're in the process of tightening the Typescript rules, making it stricter, and improving the code quality. Because of that, there is a possibility of some build issues in your existing projects, if you have a non-default setup or custom plugins.

To minimize the impact of TS strictness, we are _NOT CHANGING_ your existing `tsconfig.json` configuration. If you want to use stricter rules, you'll have to enable them yourself.  
:::

## 2. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

:::tip
