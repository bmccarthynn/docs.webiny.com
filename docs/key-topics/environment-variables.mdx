- which environment variables Webiny uses
- what is the function of each environment variable

:::info
This article contains only Webiny custom environment variables that user can set.

## Overview

Webiny uses custom environment variables to modify the behavior of certain parts of the code.
Sometimes we use the environment variables in code, instead of flags when initializing the application, so there are unnecessary passing of parameters throughout the system.

## Available Environment Variables

### DEBUG

The `DEBUG` environment variable is used to have more verbose output from the system. This is especially useful when trying to debug errors.
Default value is `false` (environment variable is not set actually). If you want more verbose output, you must set the environment variable to `true`.

Only the `true` word will have effect. If you set it to anything else, `DEBUG` will be considered as `false` / not set.

```bash
DEBUG=true
```

:::info
The `DEBUG` flag should be used only in non-production environments but, of course, you can set it in which ever environment you need or want to.

### WEBINY_ENABLE_VERSION_HEADER

The `WEBINY_ENABLE_VERSION_HEADER` environment variable is used to add the Webiny version header to all GraphQL response headers.
By default, version headers are not set into the response headers. If you want the version headers to be included, you must set the environment variable to `true`.

Only the `true` word will have effect. If you set it to anything else, `WEBINY_ENABLE_VERSION_HEADER` will be considered as `false` / not set.

```bash
WEBINY_ENABLE_VERSION_HEADER=true
```

When the environment variable is set to true it will add the `x-webiny-version` header. Which looks like this:

```yaml
x-webiny-version: 5.21.0
```
